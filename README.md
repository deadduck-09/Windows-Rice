- TranslucentTB (transparent taskbar)
- Flow Launcher (spotlight search)
   - With Yt and AI plugins
- Cava (music bars)
- I have a personal Catppuccin theme over the "Terminal" and my "Windows"
- Besides that I use Spotify with Spicetify (visualiser installed)
- Brave Browser's customizations are done separately
- Mouse Cursor is of "Hornet" from "Hollow Knight Silksong" (ss is linked at last)
